# BDR Dashboard

(experimental)


## Purpose

We're periodically asked questions about aspects the BDR, beyond what vendor-analytics can provide. Just a few examples: What are the main BDR collections? What are the most common file-types? How many items are in the BDR? Etc...

This repository will consist of of scripts that produce static snapshots to answer such stakeholder questions. (And in the future these scripts could be run via cron to populate a BDR Dashboard page to keep the data updated.)
